# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

**OBJECTIVE**
Product reviews can heavily sway shoppers decisions when using Amazon, and often times determine which products will be the most popular.  The objective of this analysis was to review the large datasets of Amazon's vine reviews, which is a product Amazon makes readily available.  In analyzing the vine reviews, the purpose was to determine whether there were any bias or favorable reviews from vine members in the selected dataset.


**RESULTS**
In total - only 22 vine members reviewed the product.
There were 26,924 non members reviews
13 of the 22 vine member reviews are 5 star reviews, which accounts for about 59% of all vine member reviews
Conversely, of the 26,924 non member reviews -  14439 were 5 star reviews or about 52%.

**SUMMARY**
The vine member reviews were almost exactly in line with the non member reviews in terms.  Due to the extremely small variance, relatively speaking, we could determine that there was no bias from the vine review members.  In order to improve the analysis, we could search the number of 1 star reviews given by vine members to determine if members were reviewing competitors products poorly
